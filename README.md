# Portail CJ Mk2

A flask portal for a local network. Eventually, should be easy to adapt to any local network with its own services.

The original code mostly comes from [here](https://framagit.org/MadEwink/lift-to-communism), but I've been rewriting it, since it's been idling by for two years now.
## Prequisites
`python3, python-flask, python-requests,
python3-pip` have to be installed.

## Usage
    $ python3 run.py
